Let me preface this by saying, love comes in many forms, and sometimes, it's wrapped up in an endless barrage of face-palming moments. Now, onto the main attraction: my husband, the crowned king of idiocy.

Firstly, the man has a knack for forgetting the most basic things. Birthdays, anniversaries, you name it. If there's a special occasion that requires the slightest bit of memory effort, you can bet he'll draw a blank. It's not just the forgetfulness that's astounding, it's his uncanny ability to remember every single sports statistic from the past decade. Ask him about our wedding anniversary? Clueless. Inquire about the 2007 Super Bowl stats? He's suddenly a walking encyclopedia.

Then, there's his sense of direction—or should I say, the lack thereof. We once took a "short" trip to the countryside, which turned into an unintended road trip across three states. All because Mr. "I Don't Need GPS" believed he had an internal compass. Spoiler alert: he doesn't. What should have been a two-hour drive morphed into a 10-hour saga, featuring scenic views of places we never planned to visit. Ever.

Cooking with him is another adventure altogether. He once decided to surprise me with breakfast in bed. Sounds lovely, right? Wrong. I woke up to the smell of burnt toast and a kitchen that looked like a scene from a disaster movie. The man had managed to use every pot and pan we owned, and for what? Charred bread and something that vaguely resembled scrambled eggs. It's a miracle the kitchen was still standing.

Don't even get me started on his DIY projects. "Why buy it when you can build it?" he says. This philosophy has led to an assortment of half-finished projects littered around our home. From shelves that can't hold anything heavier than a feather to a wobbly table that's a tetanus shot waiting to happen, his handianness leaves much to be desired.

But here's the thing: despite the endless list of facepalm-worthy moments, I can't help but laugh. There's a certain charm in his relentless optimism and his unwavering confidence in his non-existent skills. It's this infectious enthusiasm that brightens our home, turning even the most epic fails into heartwarming memories.

In the grand scheme of things, these moments of idiocy are the threads that weave the fabric of our life together. They're reminders not to take everything so seriously and that perfection is overrated. Yes, my husband may be a big idiot, but he's my idiot. And in a world that often takes itself too seriously, his brand of foolishness is a breath of fresh air.

So, here's to the big idiots in our lives—the ones who make us laugh, drive us a little crazy, and remind us that at the end of the day, it's the imperfections that make life truly interesting.
